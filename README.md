# SudokuSolver2
A more sensible approach to solving Sudoku than my previous (unfinished) SudokuSolver project.

As of November 20th, 2016, the algorythm works fine (a hard sudoku puzzle is generally solved in less than 2 seconds), but the class needs to be polished by completing a few secondary methods. Moreover I still need to add a set of methods (or maybe a dedicated class) to read the board from a file or from the user.
